# The AI Larping Engine

This is a readme file.  It is written in a language called markdown, which supports [links](https://www.markdownguide.org/), **bold**, *italics* and also things like tables:

|column A|columb B|
|:--|:--|
|stuff | goes here|

1. and
2. two
3. kinds

- of
- lists

If you navigate to a folder on github, you will see its contents.  If it contains a file called `README.md` or `README.txt` then you will see the readmen **and** its contents.  This lets you create something resembling a wiki right next to your other files.  It can be helpful for documenting how they are to be used.

Typically, readme files at the root of a repo describe the project that lives in that repo.  [Here is an example](https://github.com/mysql/mysql-server)

This github repo is public, the whole internet can see it if they want to.  Lots of great software is made in public like this.  Realistically, nobody is watching.  You typically have to work to make that happen.

I have created...

- a private repo [here](https://github.com/AR-Larping/doomsday/)
- a slack workspace [here](https://ar-larping.slack.com/)

The repo is private because we don't want players spoiling the fun by viewing the game data.  To gain acces to the private repo...

1. Create a github username

2. Go into the slack workspace.  You can either use the slack web client or you can install their software on your computer or phone.

3. Send me your Github username (I'm `@matt`) and I'll give you write access to botth this and the private repo.  I'll also add you to the `AR-larping` organization so that you can create other repo's here if you want.

4. Once I've done so, try the above link again, you should the be able to explore the other repo's.

## TODO

This is a pretty useless readme.  I intend to make it better by:

1. Copying the the game engine into a `src` folder in this repo
2. Replacing the contents of this file with an explanation of how the content of `src` is to be used
